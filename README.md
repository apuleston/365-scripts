# 365 scripts

THis is a collection of scripts for interactibg with Microsoft 365, mostly using the Microsoph.Graph PowerShell module. Maybe some other stuff if I find it useful / interesting.

I've made this repository public in response to a couple of requests for scripts from others, and I though it would be better to add some level of version control to them!
